**[Clojure Recipes](https://github.com/juliangamble/clojure-recipes) - Chapter 25 - Bundling Clojure as an Ant Plugin**

This is the code for Chapter 25 of Clojure Recipes. 

**Benefits**

The benefits of this chapter include understanding and applying a use-case that even in the workplace with the strictest coding language constraints can be used in a way that doesnâ€™t impact the production system. Modifying the build process with Clojure can be an ideal place to do that.
