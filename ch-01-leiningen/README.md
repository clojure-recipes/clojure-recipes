**[Clojure Recipes](https://github.com/juliangamble/clojure-recipes) - Chapter 1 - Starting Your Project with Leiningen**

If all works out with your Leiningen Installation - your Leiningen App template should look like this. 

**Benefits**

The benefits of Leiningen are similar to those of Maven. You will get a consistent project file structure and library dependency management. This means that other Leiningen projects will have a familiar layout and build process. It also means that you wonâ€™t have to manually download and add libraries to your project, just declare the ones you want and those libraries (and their dependencies) will be downloaded and added to your classpath.
